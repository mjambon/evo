(*
   Test whether it is faster to select an allele of one gene
   and then an allele of another gene via successive environments
   or whether a single environment that favors both is faster or
   just as fast.

   gene A, alleles a+ and a-
   gene B, alleles b+ and b-

   environment A: favors a+, neutral for other genes
   environment B: favors b+, neutral for other genes
   environment AB: favors both a+ and b+, neutral for other genes
